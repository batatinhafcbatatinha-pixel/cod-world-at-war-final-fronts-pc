"""Keep a frozen copy of the runtime headers for the generated game code.

The ~2.8k game-code objects only depend on the game ABI: R5900Context, the
memory/branch macros and the out-of-line PS2Runtime calls. Compiling them against
this snapshot means edits to VU1/GS/VIF/scheduler headers rebuild only the runtime.
The snapshot is refreshed (forcing a game-code rebuild) when an ABI header changes.

Usage: python scripts/sync_game_abi.py [--force]
